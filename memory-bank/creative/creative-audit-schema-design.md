**Date:** 2024-12-20  
**Phase:** Phase 3 - User Management & Authorization  
**Type:** Data Model Design  
**Complexity:** Level 4 (Complex System)

## ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨ ENTERING CREATIVE PHASE: AUDIT SCHEMA DESIGN ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨

### PROBLEM STATEMENT

Design a comprehensive audit logging system that:
- Captures all user actions and security events
- Supports compliance reporting and monitoring
- Provides efficient querying and analysis capabilities
- Scales to handle high-volume logging
- Maintains data integrity and security
- Enables real-time monitoring and alerting

### REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS

**Functional Requirements:**
- Log all user authentication events (login, logout, failed attempts)
- Log all RBAC changes (role assignments, permission changes)
- Log all user profile modifications
- Log all security events (suspicious activity, violations)
- Support querying by user, action, time range, event type
- Generate compliance reports (SOX, GDPR, etc.)
- Support real-time monitoring and alerting

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Performance: Sub-second query response for recent logs
- Storage: Efficient storage with retention policies
- Security: Tamper-proof audit trail
- Scalability: Support 1M+ audit events per day
- Compliance: Meet regulatory requirements
- Availability: 99.9% uptime for audit queries

**Technical Constraints:**
- Must integrate with existing PostgreSQL database
- Must work with existing User Service and RBAC system
- Must support TypeScript strict mode
- Must maintain existing API patterns
- Must be testable with Jest mocking

- Optimized for both querying and storage

**Pros:**
- Best of both worlds (flexibility + performance)
- Efficient partitioning for large datasets
- Good query performance
- Scalable for high-volume logging
- Flexible for new event types

**Cons:**
- Most complex implementation
- Requires careful partitioning strategy

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Core Audit Schema
1. **Database Schema Design**
   ```sql
   -- Main audit logs table
   CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
       id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
       user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
       event_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
       action VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
       resource_type VARCHAR(50),
       resource_id UUID,
       details JSONB,
       ip_address INET,
       user_agent TEXT,
       created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );

   -- Indexes for performance
   CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_user_id ON audit_logs(user_id);
   CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_event_type ON audit_logs(event_type);
   CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_created_at ON audit_logs(created_at);
   CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_details ON audit_logs USING GIN(details);
   ```

2. **TypeScript Interfaces**

   interface AuditLog {
       id: string;

       ipAddress?: string;
       userAgent?: string;
       createdAt: Date;
   }

       AUTHENTICATION = 'authentication',
       RBAC = 'rbac',
       PROFILE = 'profile',
       SECURITY = 'security'
   }

   interface AuthenticationEvent {
       event: 'login' | 'logout' | 'login_failed' | 'password_reset';
       success: boolean;

       permissionId?: string;
       targetUserId?: string;
   }

   interface ProfileEvent {

       fieldName?: string;
       oldValue?: any;
       newValue?: any;
