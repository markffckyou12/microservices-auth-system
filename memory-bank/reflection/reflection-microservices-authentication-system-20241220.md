# TASK REFLECTION: Microservices Authentication System

**Date:** 2024-12-20  
**Task Type:** Level 4 (Complex System)  
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Archive Reference:** `memory-bank/archive/archive-microservices-authentication-system-20241220.md`

## System Overview

### System Description
A comprehensive monorepo-based authentication system with three microservices: Auth Service, User Service, and Session Service. The system implements modern authentication patterns including JWT, OAuth, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), password management, session management, and role-based access control (RBAC). The architecture is designed for production scalability with comprehensive test coverage using mocks for all external dependencies.

### System Context
This system serves as the foundation for a larger application ecosystem, providing secure authentication and authorization services. It's designed to handle multiple authentication flows, support various OAuth providers, and maintain session state across distributed services. The system is built with TypeScript for type safety and uses modern Node.js patterns.

### Key Components
- **Auth Service** (Port 3001): Core authentication, OAuth integration, MFA features
- **User Service** (Port 3003): User management, password management, RBAC, audit logging
- **Session Service** (Port 3002): Redis-based session management and statistics
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Database schemas, migration scripts, Docker configuration
- **Testing Framework**: Jest with comprehensive mocking strategy
