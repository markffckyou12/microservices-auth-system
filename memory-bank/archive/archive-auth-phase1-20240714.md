# Archive: Phase 1 - Core Infrastructure & Basic Authentication

**Date Archived:** 2024-07-14

## Summary
Phase 1 established the foundation for the monorepo authentication system, including monorepo setup, shared utilities, PostgreSQL/Redis, Auth Service (JWT, bcrypt), basic endpoints, comprehensive tests, and Docker Compose for local development. All deliverables were completed and verified.

## Successes
- Monorepo structure and workspace setup is robust.
- Auth Service with JWT and bcrypt is functional and tested.
- Database schema and migrations are in place.
- Docker Compose enables easy local development.
- Jest-based test infrastructure with mocks is working.
- All tests pass and TypeScript build is clean.

## Challenges
- TypeScript type issues with JWT options required careful handling.
- Some dependency version mismatches and peer dependency issues during setup.
- Initial test coverage was limited; expanded to cover more scenarios.
- Docker Compose required tuning for service dependencies.

## Lessons Learned
- TypeScript strictness is valuable for catching subtle bugs, but sometimes requires pragmatic casting.
- Early investment in test infrastructure pays off for confidence and speed.
- Keeping dependencies up-to-date and compatible is critical in a monorepo.
- Docker Compose is essential for local microservice development.

## Improvements
- Consider stricter linting and CI for future phases.
- Automate more of the setup (e.g., database migrations on startup).
- Expand integration and E2E tests in future phases.
- Document environment variables and setup more clearly for onboarding.
