# ACTIVE CONTEXT

**Current Task:** Phase 3: User Management & Authorization  
**Current Mode:** CREATIVE (COMPLETED)  
**Complexity Level:** Level 4 (Complex System)  
**Date:** 2024-12-20

## CURRENT STATUS

### Phase 3: User Management & Authorization
**Status:** Creative Phases Completed  
**Progress:** Planning + Creative Design Complete  
**Next Phase:** Implementation

### Creative Phase Completion
✅ **RBAC Model and Permission Structure** - COMPLETED
- Selected: Hierarchical RBAC with Permission Inheritance
- Document: `memory-bank/creative/creative-rbac-model-design.md`

✅ **Audit Log Schema and Reporting** - COMPLETED  
- Selected: Single Audit Table with JSON Payload
- Document: `memory-bank/creative/creative-audit-schema-design.md`

✅ **Authorization Middleware Design** - COMPLETED
- Selected: Hybrid Approach with Permission Strategies
- Document: `memory-bank/creative/creative-authorization-middleware-design.md`

## IMPLEMENTATION READINESS

### Design Decisions Made
1. **RBAC Architecture**: Hierarchical RBAC with permission inheritance
2. **Audit Schema**: Single table with JSONB payload for flexibility
3. **Authorization Middleware**: Hybrid approach with permission strategies

### Implementation Plan Ready
- Database schema and migration scripts
- User Service enhancements
- RBAC core implementation
- Authorization middleware
- Audit logging system
- Integration and testing

### Dependencies Identified
- Existing User Service and database
- PostgreSQL, Redis
- Shared types/interfaces
- Creative phase design documents

## NEXT STEPS

### Recommended Mode Transition
**Current Mode:** CREATIVE (COMPLETED)  
**Next Mode:** IMPLEMENT

### Implementation Priorities
1. Database schema and migration scripts
2. RBAC core implementation
3. Authorization middleware
4. Audit logging system
5. User Service enhancements
6. Integration and testing

## KEY DECISIONS

### RBAC System
- **Approach**: Hierarchical RBAC with permission inheritance
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with proper indexing
- **Performance**: Caching for permission checks
- **Security**: Tamper-proof permission validation

### Audit System
- **Schema**: Single table with JSONB payload
- **Performance**: Efficient querying with proper indexing
- **Compliance**: Complete audit trail for regulatory requirements
- **Scalability**: Support for high-volume logging

### Authorization Middleware
- **Pattern**: Hybrid approach with permission strategies
- **Performance**: Sub-10ms permission checks with caching
- **Flexibility**: Support for both simple and complex scenarios
- **Integration**: Seamless Express.js middleware integration

## CREATIVE PHASE OUTCOMES

All three creative phases have been completed with comprehensive design decisions:

1. **RBAC Model**: Hierarchical structure with inheritance
2. **Audit Schema**: Flexible JSONB-based design
3. **Authorization Middleware**: Strategy-based hybrid approach

Each design includes:
- Multiple options analysis
- Clear decision rationale
- Implementation guidelines
- Architecture diagrams
- Validation checklists

**Ready for Implementation Mode**
