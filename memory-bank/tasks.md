#### Implementation Phases

##### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Basic Authentication (Week 1-2)
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED, REFLECTED & ARCHIVED  
**Priority:** CRITICAL

**Archive Reference:**
- See: `memory-bank/archive/archive-auth-phase1-20240714.md`

**Reflection Summary:**
- **Successes:**
  - Monorepo structure and workspace setup is robust.
  - Auth Service with JWT and bcrypt is functional and tested.
  - Database schema and migrations are in place.
  - Docker Compose enables easy local development.
  - Jest-based test infrastructure with mocks is working.
  - All tests pass and TypeScript build is clean.
- **Challenges:**
  - TypeScript type issues with JWT options required careful handling.
  - Some dependency version mismatches and peer dependency issues during setup.
  - Initial test coverage was limited; expanded to cover more scenarios.
  - Docker Compose required tuning for service dependencies.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - TypeScript strictness is valuable for catching subtle bugs, but sometimes requires pragmatic casting.
  - Early investment in test infrastructure pays off for confidence and speed.
  - Keeping dependencies up-to-date and compatible is critical in a monorepo.
  - Docker Compose is essential for local microservice development.
- **Improvements:**
  - Consider stricter linting and CI for future phases.
