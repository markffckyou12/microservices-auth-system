# PROJECT BRIEF

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
Building a comprehensive User Management System using a monorepo structure with 5 major feature areas:
1. User List/Grid View - Advanced data table with filtering, sorting, bulk operations, and export
2. User Creation Form - Multi-step wizard with validation and role assignment
3. User Detail/Profile View - Comprehensive profile with activity timeline and audit trail
4. User Edit Form - Advanced editing with inline editing and change tracking
5. User Deletion/Deactivation - Safe user management with data retention options

## PROJECT GOALS
- Create a comprehensive, enterprise-grade user management system
- Implement advanced UI/UX patterns for complex user operations
- Integrate seamlessly with existing microservices architecture
- Provide robust security, audit trails, and compliance features
- Deliver exceptional user experience with performance and accessibility

## KEY REQUIREMENTS

### Functional Requirements
- **User List/Grid View**: Pagination, search, filtering, sorting, bulk operations, export (CSV/Excel)
- **User Creation**: Multi-step wizard, real-time validation, role assignment, profile picture upload
- **User Profile**: Comprehensive display, activity timeline, permission matrix, session management
- **User Editing**: Inline editing, advanced forms, change tracking, approval workflows
- **User Deletion**: Soft delete, hard delete, data retention, cascade effects, recovery options

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Sub-2s load times, support for 1000+ users, virtual scrolling
- **Security**: JWT authentication, RBAC authorization, audit logging, input validation
- **Scalability**: Monorepo structure, microservices integration, caching strategies
- **Usability**: Intuitive navigation, responsive design, accessibility compliance
- **Reliability**: Error handling, data integrity, backup and recovery

## TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS
- Must integrate with existing Auth, User, and Session microservices
- Must leverage existing RBAC system and audit logging
- Must maintain TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Must follow existing security patterns and middleware
- Must support existing Docker deployment infrastructure

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- All 5 major feature areas fully implemented and tested
- Seamless integration with existing microservices
- Comprehensive test coverage (90%+)
- Performance benchmarks met under load
- Security audit passed with no critical vulnerabilities
- User acceptance testing completed successfully
- Documentation and training materials provided

## PROJECT SCOPE
This is a Level 4 Complex System task requiring comprehensive planning, architectural design, and phased implementation. The system will be built using React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS frontend with integration to existing Node.js microservices.

## ARCHITECTURAL APPROACH
- **Monorepo Structure**: Shared components, utilities, and types across features
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable, composable components with clear interfaces
- **State Management**: Centralized state with proper separation of concerns
- **API Integration**: Abstraction layer for microservices communication
- **Security Integration**: Leverage existing JWT and RBAC systems
- **Performance Optimization**: Virtual scrolling, pagination, caching, lazy loading
